SKU:C008

## Description 
Atom Lite, which has a size of only 24*24mm, is a very compact development board in the M5Stack development kit series. It provides more GPIOs for user customization which is very suitable for embedded smart home devices and in making smart toys. The main control adopts the ESP32-PICO chip which comes integrated with Wi-Fi technologies and has a 4MB of integrated SPI flash memory. Atom Lite board provides an IR LED, a RGB LED, buttons, and a HY2.0 interface. In addition, it can connect to external sensors and actuators through 6 GPIOs. The on-board Type-C USB interface enables rapid program upload and execution.

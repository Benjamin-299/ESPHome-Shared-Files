## Description
M5StickC is a mini M5Stack, powered by ESP32. It is a portable, easy-to-use, open source, IoT development board. What it can do? This tiny block is able to realize your idea, enlighten your creativity, and help with your IoT prototyping in a very short time. It will take away a lot of pains from the development process.M5stickC is one of the core devices in M5Stack product series.

It is built in a continually growing hardware and software ecosystem. It has a lot of compatible modules and units, as well as the open source code & engineering communities that will help you maximize your benefits in every step of the developing process.

Power switch operation:

Power on :Press power button for 2 seconds

Power off :Press power button for 6 seconds

The input range of VBUS_VIN and VBUS_USB is limited to 4.8-5.5V, and the internal battery will be charged through AXP192 power management when VBUS is powered.

Notice:

Baud rate supported by M5StickC: 1200 ~115200, 250K, 500K, 750K, 1500K
